# Test Driven Development - Fizz Buzz Kata 
## TDD guidelines:
### TypeScript - Jest minimal

Loop over until all the functionality is implemented:
1. Write a test, testing as small part of functionalities as possible
2. Implement the functionality defined in the test to make the tests pass
3. Refactor your code to make it clean

Your task :
* Write a short progra that prints one line for each number from 1 to 100.
* For each multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For each multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
